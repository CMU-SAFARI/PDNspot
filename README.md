# PDNspot

PDNspot is a framework that models the threecommonly-used PDNs in modern client processors in multi-ple metrics of interest. PDNspot provides a versatile frame-work that enables multi-dimensional architecture-space ex-ploration of modern processor PDNs. PDNspot evaluates the effect of multiple PDN parameters, TDP, and workloads onthe metrics of interest.
