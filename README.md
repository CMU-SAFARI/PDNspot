# PDNspot

PDNspot is a framework that models the three commonly-used PDNs in modern client processors in multiple metrics of interest. PDNspot provides a versatile framework that enables multi-dimensional architecture-space exploration of modern processor PDNs. PDNspot evaluates the effect of multiple PDN parameters, TDP, and workloads on the metrics of interest. 


## Using PDNspot
The tool is written in Python (PDNspot.py). To configure your PDN, update the configuration (pdns.yaml). You can update the paramters of exiting PDNs of add confiuration to your PDN.
