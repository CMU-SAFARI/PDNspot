# PDNspot

PDNspot is a framework that models the three commonly-used PDNs in modern client processors in multiple metrics of interest. PDNspot provides a versatile framework that enables multi-dimensional architecture-space exploration of modern processor PDNs. PDNspot evaluates the effect of multiple PDN parameters, TDP, and workloads on the metrics of interest.
